## Abstract
Water markets in the Western U.S. have the ability to re-allocate water temporarily during drought, often as short-term water rights leases from lower value irrigation to higher value urban uses. Regulatory approval of transfers, however, is typically lengthy and involves high transaction costs that arise from expensive technical and legal analyses, discouraging leasing.  This leads to less efficient allocation, as municipalities often react by purchasing large volumes of permanent water rights which are used only to maintain supply reliability during drought. Thus, less water is available to irrigators in wet/normal years, and municipalities pay for large volumes of infrequently used rights. This research explores the development of a multi-year two-way option (TWO) contract that pairs leasing from irrigators to urban users in drought with leases from urban users to irrigators during wet periods. The modeling framework developed to assess TWO performance includes consideration of the hydrologic, engineered, and institutional systems governing the South Platte River Basin in Colorado where increased competition for water between municipalities (e.g. Boulder), and irrigators has been observed in recent years. The framework is built around StateMod, a network-based water allocation model used by state regulators to evaluate water rights allocations and potential rights transfers.  Results suggest that the TWO could allow for reduced municipal rights holdings and costs while still maintaining urban water supply reliability, at the same time providing irrigators with increased agricultural productivity in wet years, and the ability to generate additional revenues via option payments from municipalities in dry years.

## Code reference
References for each minted software release for all code involved.  

These are generated by Zenodo automatically when conducting a release when Zenodo has been linked to your GitHub repository. The Zenodo references are built by setting the author order in order of contribution to the code using the author's GitHub user name.  This citation can, and likely should, be edited without altering the DOI.

If you have modified a codebase that is outside of a formal release, and the modifications are not planned on being merged back into a version, fork the parent repository and add a `.<shortname>` to the version number of the parent and construct your own name.  For example, `v1.2.5.hydro`.
